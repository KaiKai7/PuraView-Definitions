<h1>PuraView Definitions</h1>
<h4>a brief description of the search entry fields, and each result field in the PuraView app</h4>

<table>
  <tr>
<td></td>
    <td><h2>Search Fields<h2></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td>Name</td>
    <td>Used to search by facility name. The "Name" field can also be used to search for schools, instititutions, daycare centers and others. If the result you are looking for is not found, try again using other similiar terms. Some water systems are hard to find</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>State</td>
    <td>Used to find water systems by state location. The two digit postal state code must be used.This is a good way to find many water systems easily. But the search results are limited to 150 items, so if the results exceed 150, it is possible not all may be shown. If that is the case, simply narrow down results by using in combination with other search fields</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>City</td>
    <td>Searching by city does not neccessarily mean that a water system in that city will be returned. It really means "Cities Served". So if there are no results for the city you searched, try another nearby city. You can also put the city name in the "Name" field and search using that</td>
</tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Lead above allowed level</td>
    <td>The count of occurrences when 90th percentile sample concentrations of lead exceeded the lead action level of 0.015 mg/L in the past five years. By checking this, PuraView will return water systems with at least 1 occurrence</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<td>Serious Violator</td>
    <td>Indicates whether system is a Serious Violator (has unresolved serious, multiple, and/or continuing violations that is designated as a priority candidate for formal enforcement). Checking this will return water systems designated as a Serious Violator by the EPA</td>
  </tr>
<tr>

<td>Active</td>
    <td>If checked, the search will only return active water systems. This can help to narrow search results down to only active operating water systems</td>
  </tr>
<tr>

<td>search by contaminant</td>
    <td>This is optional, so make sure if you do not wish to use this feature, that the spinner is in the blank position. If a contaminant is showing, then this feature is active. This is extremely useful when trying to find a water system with a history of the contaminant searched. Only contaminants that were found in at least one water system were included in this feature.This was done to avoid having the user perform useless searches that will not return results</td>
  </tr>
<tr>

<td>Dictionary icon</td>
    <td>A press on the dictionary icon will open this page. And a long press on the icon will open the Contaminant Lookup page</td>
  </tr>
<tr>

<td>Submit Button</td>
    <td>The Submit button is pressed after entering the desired fields and/or checking the check boxes. Make sure to wait for the search to be performed and then display on the screen. Due to the number of results that may be returned, there may be a significant delay. 150 results are the most that can be returned and displayed. And that combined with parsing the results, can take some time. A message on the screen will indicate the status after the Submit button is pushed</td>
  </tr>
<tr>

<td>Water System</td>
    <td>This is a placeholder to display the results returned. It will display as "Water Systems 1" through "Water System 150" if there are that many results</td>

<td>State Code</td>
    <td>Displays the state where the water system is located</td>
  </tr>
<tr>

<td>Counties Served</td>
    <td>This will show the counties served by the water sytem. There are many water systems that do not show a county and instead will display null. This could be a lack of data for that entry or a system issue preventing the county from being displayed. For this reason a county search was not included. But if a county is listed for a water system it will be returned and displayed if in the records</td>
  </tr>
<tr>

<td>Registry ID</td>
    <td>The EPA Registry ID refers to a unique identifier assigned to facilities, sites, or places that are either subject to environmental regulations or of environmental interest. It’s part of the Facility Registry Service (FRS), which is a centrally managed database maintained by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The FRS provides an integrated source of air, water, and waste environmental data for various facilities1. By using the FRS ID (EPA Registry ID), data users can link information from different EPA programs together</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<td>Water System Type</td>
    <td>The EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) classifies public water systems into three types based on their characteristics and the populations they serve:

Community Water System (CWS): A CWS supplies water to the same population year-round. These systems serve residential areas, towns, and cities, providing water through pipes or other constructed conveyances. Examples include municipal water supplies that serve households and businesses.
Non-Transient Non-Community Water System (NTNCWS): An NTNCWS regularly supplies water to at least 25 of the same people for at least six months per year. These systems serve places such as schools, factories, office buildings, and hospitals that have their own water systems. The water supply is consistent and not transient.
Transient Non-Community Water System (TNCWS): A TNCWS provides water in places where people do not remain for long periods of time. Examples include gas stations, campgrounds, and other locations where people visit temporarily</td>

<td>Contaminants In Violation 3yr</td>
    <td>The SDWAContaminantsInViol3yr refers to a category of contaminants monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). These contaminants are substances that have been found to exceed the maximum allowable levels in public drinking water systems over a three-year period. </td>
  </tr>
<tr>

<td>Contaminants In Current Violation</td>
    <td>These contaminants are substances that are currently in violation of the maximum allowable levels in public drinking water systems. The EPA closely monitors these violations to ensure that corrective actions are taken promptly to protect public health and maintain safe drinking water quality.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>

<td>Current Violation Flag</td>
    <td>The CurrVioFlag is a flag used by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to indicate whether a public drinking water system is currently in violation of the maximum allowable levels for specific contaminants under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). When a water system exceeds the allowable limits for certain contaminants, it triggers corrective actions to address the violation and ensure safe drinking water quality</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<td>Serious Non Compliance</td>
    <td>Significant non-compliance (SNC) is a designation given by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to NPDES facilities with violations of a more serious nature and cause for concern. These violations will likely warrant an enforcement response by EPA or the authorized state if not promptly resolved by the permittee</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<td>Serious Violator</td>
    <td>The term SeriousViolator is used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to designate a public water system with unresolved serious, multiple, and/or continuing violations. These water systems are considered priority candidates for formal enforcement actions, as directed by EPA’s Drinking Water Enforcement Response Policy</td>
  </tr>
<tr>

<td>Lead Allowable Limit Exceeded</td>
    <td>Lead Action Level Exceedance (ALE). Water systems that exceed the lead action level are required to provide public notification to persons 
served as soon as practical but no more than 24 hours after learning of the exceedance. EPA refers to 
this type of public notification as “Tier 1”. Water systems must also consult with their State and provide 
a copy of the notice to the State and EPA within 24 hours after learning of the exceedance. Is a lead action level exceedance (ALE) a violation? 
No, an exceedance of the lead action level is not a violation. If the lead action level is exceeded in more 
than ten percent of tap water samples collected during any monitoring period (i.e., if the 90th percentile 
level is greater than the action level), a water system must take certain actions such as issuing Tier 1 PN, 
public education, optimizing corrosion control treatment, and, in some cases, replacing lead service 
lines</td>

    <td>Quarters With Violations refers to the number of quarters during which a public water system (PWS) was in violation of regulations over the past three years. This includes the 12 most recent official quarters and any new violations reported after the end of the last official quarter1. It’s an important metric for assessing water quality and compliance with environmental regulations.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>

<td>Quarters With Serious Non Compliance</td>
    <td>Quarters With Significant Non Compliance” refers to the number of quarters during which a public water system (PWS) was designated by the EPA as an enforcement priority over the past three years.
